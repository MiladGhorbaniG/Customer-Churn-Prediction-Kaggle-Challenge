# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will discontinue their subscription) based on various features in the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was checked for missing values, and any missing data was handled appropriately.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features were encoded using label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standard scaling was applied to normalize the feature values.
- **Train-Test Split**: The data was split into training and testing sets with a 80-20 ratio.
